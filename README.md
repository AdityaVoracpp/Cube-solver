this is a Python Rubiks Cube Solver, that has the option to manually enter the state OR to use automatic color detection using Open-CV.
This DOES NOT use kociemba algorithm. The algorithm is custom buit but it is less efficient.

HOW TO RUN:

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AdityaVoracpp/Cube-solver.git
cd cube-solver

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python solver.py
